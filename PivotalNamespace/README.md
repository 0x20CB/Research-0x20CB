# Pivotal Namespace: A New Method For Deriving Root Addresses That Can Be Verified Using Specific Inputs Extending To The Possibility of Multiple Use Cases And Methods With Cross-Communication

## Cross-Communication and "TrustNets"

A Pivot represents an address or namespace. It is meant to be interoperabile with other layers, with the deriviation of the pivot being known or unknown. The cross-communication protocol used can be used to establish **trust-nets**, a meshnet of sorts that relies on specific inputs that need to be guaranteed to verify.

In this instance, a proof-of-history blockchain is implored to upload specific pivot addresses and their corresponding inputs. In this way, every pivot is known and timestamped.

### TrustNet

The `TrustNet` is a web of trust like technology for deriving pivot points from already known data or communicating entities. It uses other inputs to precede its own inputs to establish trust networks with other inputs that are hard to break.

For instance, one pivot (`a`) can be derived from a secret key, one pivot (`b`) can be derived from the secret key of (`a`) and from an image, thus providing the network with security based on storage of these assets.

Shamir Secret Sharing and Threshold Signatures can be used to achieve some certain level of security while remaining powerful against attacks to integrity.

## Methods of Pivots

### Image

An image is used and processed according to the program's inputs.

This image is publically known.

### IPFS

A tree hash is used to derive a pivot point.
